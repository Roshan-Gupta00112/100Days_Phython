For Loop Uses:-
When there is a need of iteration over elements that are in sequence like lists, tuples, strings or dictionaries.
Use for loops when a known number or a finite number of iteration is required.
Another situation when you want that each element of a sequence should pass through iteration one by one.
for loops can also be used when a task requires a sequential access of elements of a sequence.




While Loop Uses:-
When there is a need to repeat execution of a block of code until a specified condition becomes False.
Use while loops when the number of iteration is not determined.
while loops are can be used when there is a need to repeat execution based on a condition.
When dynamic adaptation is required based upon condition that may change.
