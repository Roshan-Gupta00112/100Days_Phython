List:-
   i) A list is a data structure in a python that is mutable or changeable.
   ii) Elements are in ordered sequence inside list.
   iii) Each element or a value that is inside of a list is called an item.
   iv) Like Strings are defined as characters between quotes, Lists are defined by having values between
        square brackets []
   v) List stores element inside square brackets, []


Few Methods of List are:-
    1. append:- To add an itm inside list. e.g list_name.append(any_variable)
    2. extend:- To add a list of items in a existing list at once. e.g list_name.extend(list2_name) or
                    list_name.extend([1, 2, 'a', 'roshan is a billionaire'])
    3. insert:- To insert an item at given index. e.g list_name.insert(0, 0.0), It insert 0.0 at index 0 in list_name
                    and hence the previous items from that index shifted by 1 position
    4. remove:- remove the first occurrence of that item.
                    e.g list_name.remove(x), This will remove the first occurrence of item x from list_name
    5. pop:- Remove and Return the item at the mentioned index.
                    e.g list_name.pop(2), This will remove the item present at index 2 from list_name list.
                        If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.
    6. clear:- Remove all items from the list
                    e.g list_name.clear(), This will remove the all items from the list_name and hence list_name
                         list becomes empty
    7.list.index(x_item, start_index, end_index)
                    Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x between the
                    start_index and end_index where start_index is inclusive while end_index is exclusive.
    8. list.count(x)
                    Return the number of times item(x in this case) appears in the list.
    9. list.sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)
                    Sort the items of the list in place.
       list.sort(reverse=True) -- This will sort the list in Descending Order
    10. list.reverse()
                     Reverse the elements of the list in place.
    11. list.copy()
                     Return a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:].
