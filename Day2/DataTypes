There are 5 data types. Which are following:-

1. Numeric:- Integer, Float, Complex Number

2. Boolean:- It has 2 values, Ture and False

3. Dictionary:- Dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs like HashMap in java

4. Set:-
        a. It is a collection of non-repetitive element.
        b. It is an unordered.
        c. sets are un-indexed which means we cannot access elements by index
        d. We cannot change an item in set
        e. sets cannot contain duplicates
        f. empty set defined like:- var = set()
        g. set store every item inside curly brackets. e.g var = {1, "Ros", True}

5. Sequence:- String, Tuple, List

        b. Tuple:-
                 i) Set stores elements inside round brackets, ()
                 ii) empty tuple, e.g var = ()  ,aware of set definition for empty set
                 iii) single element tuple, e.g var = (1,). Note:- For single element Tuple we must have to use comma
                     after the element otherwise it is considered as variable not Tuple

        c. List:-
               i) List stores element inside square brackets, []


NOTE:-
      1. To know the data type of a variable in Python we have to use, type(variableName)
      2. To change the data type of a variable in Python we need to use, desiredDataType(variable)
